Prepare Benchmark Data
======================
Converts human_labels.json into the benchmark format expected by benchmark.py.

For each labeled image (excluding "reject" entries):
  - Uses the human caption as the true caption
  - Selects 2 distractors that are semantically DIFFERENT from the true caption
    (avoids captions with high word overlap to make the benchmark meaningful)
  - Randomizes the position of the true caption

Usage:
  python prepare_benchmark_data.py --input /path/to/human_labels.json --output benchmark_data.json
